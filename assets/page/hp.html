              Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students
              possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage,
              chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.
              The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and
              gold and its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir
              Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless
              Nick", was the House ghost. Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the
              element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours
              scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of
              fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet
              representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat. The
              Gryffindor motto was "Forti Animo Estote", which was displayed on
              a stained glass window in the common room.

              In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to
              pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most
              valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness,
              leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tended to clique
              together (often acquiring leaders) which further exemplified
              Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco
              Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and Tom
              Riddle's gang (which later became the Death Eaters). The founder
              highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat
              admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted. Students of
              any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a
              Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite
              rare. The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the
              house's colours were green and silver. There were two notable
              heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first
              leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until
              leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape. The patron ghost of the
              house was the Bloody Baron.Slytherin corresponded roughly with the
              element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with
              the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as
              serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly,
              in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world,
              leading some to believe that the element was chosen to symbolise a
              Slytherin's dream for a world in which their goals and ambitions
              had finally been achieved. Others speculate that it was chosen to
              symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pureblood-only wizarding
              society.[citation needed] The colours also corresponded with
              waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being
              often associated with grey rainwater.

              Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff
              was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work,
              dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a
              particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal was a
              badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of
              Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's
              patron ghost. Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of
              earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were
              chosen: yellow represented golden wheat, while black was
              emblematic of fertile soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass
              contained yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often
              demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their
              correspondence to earth.

              Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of
              this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom.
              The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze
              were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and
              the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw,
              daughter of Rowena. Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element
              of air, and it was for that reason that the House colours were
              chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers
              respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw
              points hourglass contained blue sapphires.
